\usage{
create_map_df(locator)
}
\arguments{
\item{locator}{The a vector of ISO3 country code's that you want data about. (http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49alpha.htm) or the basin ID's [1-468] (http://data.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/climate_data_api_basins.pdf)}
}
\description{
A function that will download maps for a vector of basins or country codes and return a data frame that has the kml output processed such that it can be plotted with ggplot2 and other mapping functions:
}
\details{
kml files can be quite large (100k-600k per country) making downloading them every time you want to make a map time consuming.  To 
reduce this time it's easiest to download kml files and store them.  To set the directory use a line like this: \code{options(kmlpath="/Users/emh/kmltemp")}  The option must be called "kmlpath".  These files will be persistent until you delete them.

\examples{
\dontrun{
to_map <- create_map_df(c("USA","MEX","CAN"))
ggplot(to_map, aes(x=long, y=lat,group=group))+ geom_polygon()
